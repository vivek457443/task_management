2. **Sections:** The app offers four sections: "My Day," "Current Week," "Current Month," and "All Tasks." Click on the respective section links to view tasks that match the criteria.

3. **Checkbox:** Each task has a checkbox beside it. Check the box to mark a task as completed. Uncheck it to mark it as pending.

## Important Notes ⚠️

- Please ensure to fill both the task description and due date fields before adding a new task.
- Tasks are sorted based on due dates in ascending order.
- This app is completely responsive.
- For the app to work properly, you need to host it on a localhost or a server. Simply opening the index file as a web page won't provide the required functionality.
